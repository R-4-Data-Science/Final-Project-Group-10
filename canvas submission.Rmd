This file provides examples for users to understand our code and how to implement it. 



##3.1: Foward Path Selection
```{r}
# Example data
data(mtcars)

# Define response + predictors
response <- "mpg"
predictors <- setdiff(colnames(mtcars), response)

# Run forward path selection
result <- forward_path_selection(
  data = mtcars,
  response = response,
  predictors = predictors,
  delta = 2,
  eps = 0.1,
  L = 10,
  verbose = TRUE
)

# --- Inspecting results ---

# List of frontiers by step
result$path_forest

# AIC by model key
result$aic_by_model

# Meta info
result$meta
```

##5.1: Forward Tree Algorithm

#Linear Regression of Forward Tree Algorithm (Gaussian)
```{r}
# Data
data(mtcars)
X <- mtcars[, setdiff(names(mtcars), "mpg")]
y <- mtcars$mpg

# Run forward tree algorithm
result_gaussian <- algorithm_forward_tree(
  X = X,
  y = y,
  family = "gaussian",
  K = 3,   # max steps
  eps = 0.1,
  delta = 2,
  L = 5
)

# Inspect models by step
result_gaussian$models_by_step

```


#Logistic Regression of Forward Tree Algorithm (Gaussian)
```{r}
y_bin <- ifelse(mtcars$mpg > 20, 1, 0)
X <- mtcars[, setdiff(names(mtcars), "mpg")]

result_binomial <- algorithm_forward_tree(
  X = X,
  y = y_bin,
  family = "binomial",
  K = 3,
  eps = 0.1,
  delta = 2,
  L = 5
)

result_binomial$models_by_step

```
