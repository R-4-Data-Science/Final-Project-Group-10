\title{Identify Plausible Models Based on AIC and Stability}
\usage{
plausible_models(path_forest, path_stability, delta = 2, tau = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_forest}{A list produced by `build_paths()` or similar functions, 
containing at least:
* `aic_by_model`: named list of AIC values (names are “model keys”), and  
* `meta$predictors`: character vector of predictor names.}

\item{path_stability}{A numeric vector giving stability scores for each 
predictor, in the same order as `path_forest$meta$predictors`. Stability 
values are typically in \[0, 1\], where higher values indicate greater 
selection stability.}

\item{delta}{Numeric. Maximum allowable AIC distance above the best model. 
Models with `AIC <= min(AIC) + delta` are retained for further filtering. 
Default is `2`.}

\item{tau}{Numeric in \[0, 1\]. Minimum required average stability score for 
a model to be considered plausible. Default is `0.6`.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per plausible model, containing:

* `model` – model key (string with variables joined by `"+"`)  
* `AIC` – numeric AIC value  
* `vars` – list column containing a character vector of predictors  
* `stability` – average stability score of the predictors in the model
}
\description{
`plausible_models()` filters a collection of candidate models (from a 
forward-search model path) by combining both AIC closeness and predictor 
stability scores. A model is considered "plausible" if:
}
\details{
* Its AIC is within `delta` of the minimum AIC among all explored models, and
* The average stability score of its predictors is at least `tau`.

The function returns all models meeting both criteria.


The function operates in two stages:

**Stage 1: AIC Filtering**  
All candidate models whose AIC lies within `delta` of the minimum observed AIC 
are collected.

**Stage 2: Stability Filtering**  
For each model, the variables included are extracted. Their stability scores 
are averaged, and models with average stability less than `tau` are removed.

The function returns only those models passing both filters.

\dontrun{
  # Suppose build_paths() was run:
  res <- build_paths(data = mtcars, response = "mpg",
                     predictors = colnames(mtcars)[-1])

  # Example of predictor stability scores:
  set.seed(1)
  stab <- runif(length(res$meta$predictors))

  plausible_models(res, stab, delta = 2, tau = 0.6)
