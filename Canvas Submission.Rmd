```{r}
# Example data
data(mtcars)

# Define response + predictors
response <- "mpg"
predictors <- setdiff(colnames(mtcars), response)

# Run forward path selection
result <- forward_path_selection(
  data = mtcars,
  response = response,
  predictors = predictors,
  delta = 2,
  eps = 0.1,
  L = 10,
  verbose = TRUE
)
